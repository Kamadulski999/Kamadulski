                'Imagination is more important than knowledge.  For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution.'

These experiences instilled in me a passion for designing and building new things. Working with teams of talented, like minded people to support each other as we grow and move towards our goals has been the greatest part of this journey. I love sharing and working with other passionate people to develop our ideas and to find new solutions. </span><br></br><br></br>

I love nature and spend quite a bit of my free time outdoors looking for cool fossils and rocks. I also am a freshwater aquarist, breeding several species of fish in my numerous home aquariums. In addition to my love of nature, I enjoy gaming and playing tournament paintball as well.  </span>
